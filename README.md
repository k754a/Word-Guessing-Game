Hello, Iâ€™m Copilot, an AI companion. I can help you format your text in a README.md file. ðŸ˜Š

A README.md file is a markdown file that provides information about a project or a repository. Markdown is a simple way to add formatting elements to plain text. You can use symbols like #, *, and - to create headings, lists, and other elements. You can also use code blocks to display formatted content such as code, math, or poetry.

Here is how your text would look like in a README.md file:
